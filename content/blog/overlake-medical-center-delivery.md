title: Overlake Medical Center Delivery!
description: For those who have been following our organization's journey,  we
  were able to accomplish our first note delivery!
---
When we delivered the first supply of 40 notes to the Overlake Medical Center, we were approached with joyous faces! With many of the workers expecting our appearance, they dove right into reading the notes made by the community.

> A member of the Intensive Care Unit exclaimed to us, "Thank you for your thoughtful messages, we are so grateful to serve!"

In these dire times, with many finding isolation to be difficult to maintain, it is very important that we remember that the medical community is taking risky steps in order to ensure our physical health. The stress they endure to provide others with a sense of peace amid the calamity is something that must be recognized.

> "We are all serving in different ways to help the world we live in." 

This quote by another member of the Intensive Care Unit summarizes the potential everyone has to help better their local towns. We encourage you guys to take steps and strive to help anyone you see in need.

Don't forget to write some more notes! We'll catch you guys up on our future deliveries~
